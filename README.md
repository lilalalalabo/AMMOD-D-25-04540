Algorithm_1.py provides the entire process from collecting file data to obtaining the parameters of the distribution uncertainty set.

What's more, ev_ownership_scenarios_final_corrected_v2.csv presents the inventory results of 15 different scenarios obtained through Algorithm 1, and ev_ownership_statistics_final_corrected_v2.csv provides the statistical information obtained from these 15 different scenarios.

The Demand data.xlsx shows the paramters we use in the distribution uncertainty set and rsulting scenario sets to compute the moments for the ambiguity set.

The Points data.xlsx provides the coordinates (Cartesian) for all 20 demand points and 30 candidate charging station locations, at the same time the maximum capacity, and annual rental cost (Szj ) for all 30 candidate charging station
locations.
